### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I've been diving deep into **Python** and **Rust** for the past decade, with an emphasis on **data engineering** and **systems programming** on **Linux**. I'm **available for hire** now.

If you need a **contributor** or **maintainer** for your project written with Python and/or Rust and/or on Linux, feel free to ping me. I really encourage this kind of requests. Yes, it's better to work for money, but I prefer both money and fun. :) Just fun is sometimes fine too.

### Note to code readers
I'm sorry if my code hurts your feelings. Please, if you have a spare minute, [share your thoughts](https://t.me/walsk). Thanks.

### Note to team leaders
If you read this - thanks! Could I improve anything? Do you have a question? [Welcome](https://t.me/walsk).

### good-first-issue
If you want to contribute, but don't know, where to start, I can make a `good-first-issue` for you. Many ideas. :)

### 5 curious facts about me
- open source contributor since 2013
- volunteer in various projects (mostly amateur aviation) since ~2010
- purely Linux desktop since ~2015 (Gentoo compilation - check, LFS - check, also Arch, Manjaro, SLES, Qubes)
- I celebrate Donald Knuth's birthday (it's my tradition, I think he would chuckle if he knew)
- big fan of [SIGBOVIK](https://sigbovik.org/) and Harry Quest Bovik himself
