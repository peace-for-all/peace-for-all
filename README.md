If you want to contribute, but don't know, where to start, I can make a `good-first-issue` for you. Many ideas. :)

### 5 curious facts about me
- open source contributor since 2013
- volunteer in various projects (mostly amateur aviation) since ~2010
- purely Linux desktop since ~2015 (Gentoo compilation - check, LFS - check, also Arch, Manjaro, SLES, Qubes)
- I celebrate Donald Knuth's birthday (it's my tradition, I think he would chuckle if he knew)
- big fan of [SIGBOVIK](https://sigbovik.org/) and Harry Quest Bovik himself
